With the energy crisis hitting Britain in September 2021 and worries of a fuel shortage, we 
devised an app to help people avoid queues and save the environment. FuelOpt is a user-friendly,
open-source, platform-independent and socially helpful app to assist motorists in planning and optimising 
their fuel-filling journeys in terms of cost, time, and fuel efficiency. Currently, the application
focuses on the geographic area of London, UK, where the shortage was mostly felt.
